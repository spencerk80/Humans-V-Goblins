#Hummans V Goblins
This is a very simple text RPG that shows the player a map and lets them roam around. Enemies exist on the map and if the player collides with them, combat will initiate. Goblins may drop items on their defeat. Players have an inventory so they can use health potions to heal. There are also chests that spawn on the map that will give players items.
